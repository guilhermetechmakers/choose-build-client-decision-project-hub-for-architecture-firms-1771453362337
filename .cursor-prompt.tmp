# Modern Design Best Practices

## Philosophy

Create unique, memorable experiences while maintaining consistency through modern design principles. Every project should feel distinct yet professional, innovative yet intuitive.

---

## Landing Pages & Marketing Sites

### Hero Sections
**Go beyond static backgrounds:**
- Animated gradients with subtle movement
- Particle systems or geometric shapes floating
- Interactive canvas backgrounds (Three.js, WebGL)
- Video backgrounds with proper fallbacks
- Parallax scrolling effects
- Gradient mesh animations
- Morphing blob animations


### Layout Patterns
**Use modern grid systems:**
- Bento grids (asymmetric card layouts)
- Masonry layouts for varied content
- Feature sections with diagonal cuts or curves
- Overlapping elements with proper z-index
- Split-screen designs with scroll-triggered reveals

**Avoid:** Traditional 3-column equal grids

### Scroll Animations
**Engage users as they scroll:**
- Fade-in and slide-up animations for sections
- Scroll-triggered parallax effects
- Progress indicators for long pages
- Sticky elements that transform on scroll
- Horizontal scroll sections for portfolios
- Text reveal animations (word by word, letter by letter)
- Number counters animating into view

**Avoid:** Static pages with no scroll interaction

### Call-to-Action Areas
**Make CTAs impossible to miss:**
- Gradient buttons with hover effects
- Floating action buttons with micro-interactions
- Animated borders or glowing effects
- Scale/lift on hover
- Interactive elements that respond to mouse position
- Pulsing indicators for primary actions

---

## Dashboard Applications

### Layout Structure
**Always use collapsible side navigation:**
- Sidebar that can collapse to icons only
- Smooth transition animations between states
- Persistent navigation state (remember user preference)
- Mobile: drawer that slides in/out
- Desktop: sidebar with expand/collapse toggle
- Icons visible even when collapsed

**Structure:**
```
/dashboard (layout wrapper with sidebar)
  /dashboard/overview
  /dashboard/analytics
  /dashboard/settings
  /dashboard/users
  /dashboard/projects
```

All dashboard pages should be nested inside the dashboard layout, not separate routes.

### Data Tables
**Modern table design:**
- Sticky headers on scroll
- Row hover states with subtle elevation
- Sortable columns with clear indicators
- Pagination with items-per-page control
- Search/filter with instant feedback
- Selection checkboxes with bulk actions
- Responsive: cards on mobile, table on desktop
- Loading skeletons, not spinners
- Empty states with illustrations or helpful text

**Use modern table libraries:**
- TanStack Table (React Table v8)
- AG Grid for complex data
- Data Grid from MUI (if using MUI)

### Charts & Visualizations
**Use the latest charting libraries:**
- Recharts (for React, simple charts)
- Chart.js v4 (versatile, well-maintained)
- Apache ECharts (advanced, interactive)
- D3.js (custom, complex visualizations)
- Tremor (for dashboards, built on Recharts)

**Chart best practices:**
- Animated transitions when data changes
- Interactive tooltips with detailed info
- Responsive sizing
- Color scheme matching design system
- Legend placement that doesn't obstruct data
- Loading states while fetching data

### Dashboard Cards
**Metric cards should stand out:**
- Gradient backgrounds or colored accents
- Trend indicators (↑ ↓ with color coding)
- Sparkline charts for historical data
- Hover effects revealing more detail
- Icon representing the metric
- Comparison to previous period

---

## Color & Visual Design

### Color Palettes
**Create depth with gradients:**
- Primary gradient (not just solid primary color)
- Subtle background gradients
- Gradient text for headings
- Gradient borders on cards
- Elevated surfaces for depth

**Color usage:**
- 60-30-10 rule (dominant, secondary, accent)
- Consistent semantic colors (success, warning, error)
- Accessible contrast ratios (WCAG AA minimum)

### Typography
**Create hierarchy through contrast:**
- Large, bold headings (48-72px for heroes)
- Clear size differences between levels
- Variable font weights (300, 400, 600, 700)
- Letter spacing for small caps
- Line height 1.5-1.7 for body text
- Inter, Poppins, or DM Sans for modern feel

### Shadows & Depth
**Layer UI elements:**
- Multi-layer shadows for realistic depth
- Colored shadows matching element color
- Elevated states on hover
- Neumorphism for special elements (sparingly)

---

## Interactions & Micro-animations

### Button Interactions
**Every button should react:**
- Scale slightly on hover (1.02-1.05)
- Lift with shadow on hover
- Ripple effect on click
- Loading state with spinner or progress
- Disabled state clearly visible
- Success state with checkmark animation

### Card Interactions
**Make cards feel alive:**
- Lift on hover with increased shadow
- Subtle border glow on hover
- Tilt effect following mouse (3D transform)
- Smooth transitions (200-300ms)
- Click feedback for interactive cards

### Form Interactions
**Guide users through forms:**
- Input focus states with border color change
- Floating labels that animate up
- Real-time validation with inline messages
- Success checkmarks for valid inputs
- Error states with shake animation
- Password strength indicators
- Character count for text areas

### Page Transitions
**Smooth between views:**
- Fade + slide for page changes
- Skeleton loaders during data fetch
- Optimistic UI updates
- Stagger animations for lists
- Route transition animations

---

## Mobile Responsiveness

### Mobile-First Approach
**Design for mobile, enhance for desktop:**
- Touch targets minimum 44x44px
- Generous padding and spacing
- Sticky bottom navigation on mobile

### Responsive Patterns
**Adapt layouts intelligently:**
- Hamburger menu → full nav bar
- Card grid → stack on mobile
- Sidebar → drawer
- Multi-column → single column
- Data tables → card list
- Hide/show elements based on viewport

---

## Loading & Empty States

### Loading States
**Never leave users wondering:**
- Skeleton screens matching content layout
- Progress bars for known durations
- Animated placeholders
- Spinners only for short waits (<3s)
- Stagger loading for multiple elements
- Shimmer effects on skeletons

### Empty States
**Make empty states helpful:**
- Illustrations or icons

## Data Schema to be Implemented

**Database Tables:**

```sql
-- login_/_signup table
CREATE TABLE login_/_signup (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'active',
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()

**Row Level Security (RLS):**

```sql
-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE login_/_signup ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Users can read their own data
CREATE POLICY "login_/_signup_read_own" ON login_/_signup
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "login_/_signup_insert_own" ON login_/_signup
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Users can update their own data
CREATE POLICY "login_/_signup_update_own" ON login_/_signup
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Users can delete their own data
CREATE POLICY "login_/_signup_delete_own" ON login_/_signup
  FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

 for bestpractices and # Project Board (Timeline & Phases)

## Complete Description

Implement the project-specific timeline view showing project phases (kickoff, concept, schematic, DD, permitting, CA, handover), milestones, and decision checkpoints. Key deliverables: horizontal phase bars with percent complete and milestone markers; milestone cards (name, due date, assignee, status); embedded decision checkpoint links into phases; list and Gantt-lite toggle with drag-to-reschedule (permission-checked); filters for actionable items/overdue/approvals needed; action bar for adding milestones, publishing decisions, and scheduling meetings. Provide API endpoints to fetch/update timeline and milestones and integrate with Decision Log links and project-level permissions.

**Scope Context:**
- **Type:** page
- **Purpose:** Project and workload overview for logged-in users: active projects, pending approvals, upcoming meetings, recent activity and KPIs.

**Required Elements:**
- **Left Navigation: Projects, Decisions, Messages, Files, Templates, Reports, Settings**: Required UI component - implement per scope description
- **Topbar: search, notifications bell, quick create (+) button, user avatar**: Required UI component - implement per scope description
- **Projects List: active projects with progress bars and phase tag**: Required UI component - implement per scope description
- **Pending Approvals Widget: list of decision cards awaiting client sign-off**: Required UI component - implement per scope description
- **Activity Feed: chronological events (approvals, uploads, comments)**: Required UI component - implement per scope description
- **Upcoming Meetings and Tasks: calendar snippet**: Required UI component - implement per scope description
- **Quick Actions: publish decision, create meeting, invite client**: Required UI component - implement per scope description

## Problem & Solution

**Problem:** Project and workload overview for logged-in users: active projects, pending approvals, upcoming meetings, recent activity and KPIs.

**Solution:** This feature provides Project and workload overview for logged-in users: active projects, pending approvals, upcoming meetings, recent activity and KPIs.

**Value proposition:** Project Board (Timeline & Phases) enables users to complete their workflow efficiently.

## UI Guidelines

**Design System:**
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Use Shadcn UI components for consistency
- Apply Radix UI for accessible primitives
- Implement responsive design (mobile-first approach)

**Component Structure:**
- Main page container with proper layout
- Header section with title and actions
- Content area with data display/forms
- Loading states with skeleton loaders
- Error states with user-friendly messages
- Empty states with helpful guidance

**Visual States:**
- Initial/Empty: Clear placeholder content
- Loading: Skeleton loaders or spinners
- Success: Data display with proper formatting
- Error: User-friendly error messages with retry options

**Interactions:**
- Hover effects on interactive elements
